        <p>
          A self-taught web developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience
          building for the modern web. I specialize in creating responsive,
          accessible, and performant web applications using technologies like
          React, Next.js, and Node.js. My work is driven by a strong
          understanding of both frontend and backend development, enabling me to
          bridge the gap between design and engineering. I focus on writing
          clean, maintainable code and delivering solutions that are scalable,
          user-centric, and aligned with business goals. Whether it's developing
          intuitive UIs, integrating APIs, or optimizing performance, I bring
          thoughtful problem-solving and a product mindset to every project.
